## PRE-PROGRAMME: TO R
## LAST RETAKE

# Please, read carefully these instructions and answer the questions below using R code:
# Import the necessary libraries to complete the tasks.
# If you need to insert comments in your script use #
# Save the script (the script has to be fully executable by me) with the questions and answers and send it by email to: ruben.coca@esade.edu
# Import the csv file loan_data.csv that you downloaded from the Moodle and stored in the 
# ./DATA/ folder of your RStudio project. Create the object df to do so.


## QUESTIONS:
# Q1 (1 point) Compute the average of loan_amnt.

# Q2 (1 point) How many different/unique values has the variable purpose?

# Q3 (1.5 points) Create a new object called df2 keeping only rows in df that meet this condition: home_ownership is 'RENT' or purpose is not 'educational'

# Q4 (1.5 points) Plot a histogram showing the distribution of variable annual_inc.

# Q5 (2.5 points) Create a new object called df3 that is the result of computing the standard deviation of int_rate for any different value in home_ownership. Order results in ascending order.

# Q6 (2.5 points) Using ggplot2 library, create a line plot showing the evolution of defaults over time (issue_date). Transform data before plotting, if necessary.
